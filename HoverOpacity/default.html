        <h1>Opacity</h1>
        <img src="../images/IamMaruBookCover.jpg">
        <p>Opacity is a value representing how opaque something should be. A value of 1.0 means it is fully opaque: you can see it, and you can see nothing through it. A value 0.0 means it is fully transparent: You can't see it's there.</p>
        <p>
            Often times elements with opacity of 0.0 are also given a pointer-events property of none. This prevents the mouse from responding to something the user cannot see.

        <h1>Hover Refresher</h1>
        <img src="../images/IamMaruBookCover.jpg">
        <p>The :hover pseudoclass allows the styling to change when the user's mouse hovers over an element. This is often used with links and buttons to show it's active. We also used with table rows to highlight the one they were looking at and make it easier to follow the data.  </p>

        <h1>Space or Arrow selector modifier</h1>
        <img src="../images/IamMaruBookCover.jpg">
        <p>A space in a css selector means "inside of". So when we read our selectors backwards, with an exampe like 'nav a', we'd get "an 'a' element inside a 'nav' element'</p>
        <p>
            There is also an arrow modifier (>).  It's like the space, but more specific. It means 'directly inside', or 'an immediate child of'. So 'nav > a' would mean an 'a' element that is a direct child of a 'nav' element.

        <h1>Transition</h1>
        <img src="../images/IamMaruBookCover.jpg">
        <p>A transition rule tells how long a property change should take to complete.  So if you change opacity from 0 to 1 on hover, and a transition: 1s, it will gradually become more visible across 1 second.</p>
