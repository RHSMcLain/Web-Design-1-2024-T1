        <h1>Opacity</h1>
        <img src="../images/IamMaruBookCover.jpg">
        <p>Opacity is a value representing how opaque something should be. A value of 1.0 means it is fully opaque: you can see it, and you can see nothing through it. A value 0.0 means it is fully transparent: You can't see it's there.</p>
        <p>
            Often times elements with opacity of 0.0 are also given a pointer-events property of none. This prevents the mouse from responding to something the user cannot see.
